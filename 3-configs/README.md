# Configuration Examples

This directory contains **reference configuration files** used in Linux system
administration and operations.

## Scope
- Service configuration templates
- System-level configuration examples
- Network, storage, security, and runtime settings

## Principles
- Configs are **examples**, not environment-specific
- Sensitive values must be removed or anonymized
- Each config should be understandable in isolation

## Usage
- Use as reference when configuring real systems
- Compare against production configs for diff and audit
- Do not copy blindly without validation

## Notes
- Prefer minimal, readable configurations
- Document non-obvious parameters inline
